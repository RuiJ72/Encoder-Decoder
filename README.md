#
Text Encoder/Decoder implemented in Java
It changes the vowels, keeping the rest of the original text. It does not allow the insertion of any special characters or capital letters  

Encoding:

a == "ai"
e == enter
i == imes
o == ober
u == ufat

#
The project follows the original project line of Oracle Next Education One challenge, proposed to be implemented in Javascript with the use of html and Css.

This Java Encoder and Decoder does not use any graphical interface, being a console application.

Using a RegEx validates only allowed characters: only no special characters or lower case letters are allowed
